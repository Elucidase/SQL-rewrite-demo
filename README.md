# SQL-rewrite
It is part of a research project I'm now doing with one of the faculty. The code is an implementation of one of the SQL-rewriting rule that I summarized based on the execution plans of PostgreSQL on fast and slow queries. The purpose is to find potential common operations so that later we might invent a domain-specific language that describes SQL-rewriting rules systematically.
